![FinTech-1](FinTech-1.jpg) 

## **What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?**
### Kiva is a non-profit organization that extends “microloans”, which loans as small as a few hundred dollars to impoverished borrowers, with the expectation that they will start a business and be able to repay the loan. ###

### Microlending has been shown to aid extremely poor people in third world countries in starting small businesses. ###

## **Main Competitor(s)**
### Grameen Bank

## **Where Do We Apply Fintech**
### Kiva is in the process of setting up payments directly to borrowers via PayPal (so-called Direct Loans), rather than through local organizations (which provide so-called Partner Loans). At present, Direct Loans cost so much less to administer that Direct Loan borrowers pay no interest or fees, but Partner Loan borrowers pay the above rates. ###

## **How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?**
